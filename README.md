The DOOM Fire Algorithm is a JavaScript-based program that generates a mesmerizing fire effect using a pixel matrix. Fire intensities are calculated and updated over time, creating a dynamic and visually stunning display.

## Features

- Fire simulation using pixel manipulation.
- Configurable fire dimensions and colors.
- Easy integration into web projects.
- Visually captivating experience.

## Usage

To start the DOOM Fire Algorithm simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Watch in awe as the fire comes to life on your screen! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Feel free to customize the fire dimensions and colors by modifying the variables in the code.
